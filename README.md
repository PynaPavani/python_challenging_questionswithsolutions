# Python Challenging Questions and Solutions

Welcome to the **Python Challenging Questions and Solutions** repository! This project contains a collection of Python-based problem-solving exercises designed to sharpen your coding skills and deepen your understanding of key programming concepts.

## üìú About the Project

This repository features a variety of **challenging Python questions** along with their corresponding **solutions**. These challenges cover a wide range of topics, including:

- String manipulation
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- Algorithmic problems
- Recursion
- Object-oriented programming
- File handling and I/O
- Error handling
- Data processing
- Advanced concepts like generators, decorators, and more!

These exercises are designed to be practical, enhancing your ability to solve real-world problems while developing your Python proficiency.

## üí° Why This Project?

Whether you're a beginner looking to practice coding or an experienced developer looking for a good brain-teasing exercise, these challenges provide a great opportunity for:
- **Learning new Python concepts** in an interactive way.
- **Improving problem-solving** skills through various coding puzzles.
- **Preparing for technical interviews** by tackling common coding problems.
- **Contributing and expanding the collection** of problems and solutions as the community grows.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PynaPavani/python_challenging_questionswithsolutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd python_challenging_questionswithsolutions
   ```

3. Explore the problems and solutions in different Python files. Each file is well-documented with the problem statement, solution, and explanation.

4. Run any Python script to run in jupyter notebook or vscode try out the solution or tweak the code to experiment with different approaches:

   ```bash
    run main.ipynb 
   ```
there will be mainly 3 levels of python questions will be present in the .txt file
- **Beginner:** Basic problems for those just starting out with Python.
- **Intermediate:** Moderate-level problems requiring deeper knowledge of Python features.
- **Advanced:** Challenging problems that involve complex logic and advanced concepts.

Each file follows a structure like:

```python
# Problem Statement
"""
Write a program to convert an ASCII string to a unicode string encoded by utf-8.
"""

# Solution
def ascii_to_unicode(ascii_str):
    return ascii_str.encode('utf-8')

# Example usage
ascii_string = "Hello, World!"
unicode_string = ascii_to_unicode(ascii_string)
print(unicode_string)
```

## üåü Key Features

- **Detailed problem descriptions** and explanations for each solution.
- **Well-commented code** to make understanding the solution easier.
- **Variety of problem topics** to cover different aspects of Python programming.
